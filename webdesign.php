		<p>I build <strong>clean websites with solid code.</strong> I pay lots of attention to <strong>usability</strong> and little bitty details you probably wouldnâ€™t notice, but add to an overall quality of the site. Great navigation in a web site is very important. Your viewers need to know where they are, where they can go and how to get back. Given that you probably have <strong>mere seconds to grab your viewers</strong> you need your site to be clear and well made.</p>
		<p>I generally write code in <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>, which are the newest versions of HTML and CSS and backwards compatible with older browsers, as well as <strong>PHP/MySQL, Javascript</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong>.</p>
